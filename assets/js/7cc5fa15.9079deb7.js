Recently, generative artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance. Machine learning approaches have been applied to large language models, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine, where it is too costly to develop algorithms to perform the needed tasks.","permalink":"/site/docs/machine-learning/intro"},{"id":"machine-learning/start-with-iris-dataset","title":"Start with Iris Dataset","description":"Machine learning mainly includes preprocessing, learning, evaluation and prediction stages.
